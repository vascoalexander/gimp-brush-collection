# Gimp Brushcollection

### A **large** Collection of "raw" Brushes for Gimp

This is the batch conversion of my Image Collection that i use to create brushpacks. The images are saved with a brush spacing of 1; folder and file names are the same as in the image collection â€“ so you can work with both formats if you want, and easily find corresponding files.
