# Gimp Brushcollection

### A **large** Collection of "raw" Brushes for Gimp

This is the batch conversion of my Image Collection that i use to create brushpacks. The images are saved with a brush spacing of 1; folder and file names are the same as in the image collection â€“ so you can work with both formats if you want, and easily find corresponding files.

~~Image-Galleries~~ (Gone due Google Plus being dead)

Note: This is a "raw" resource (not adjusted or proofed) meant to help people creating their own custom brushes or brushpacks and share their work if they want without thinking about license restrictrictions. 

All Brushes in this Package are created by me. **You can use this resource for whatever you want without any restrictions.**
